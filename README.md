# FDF to Comment Response

FDF to Comment Response is a simple web application that converts `.fdf` files containing comments exported from `.pdf` files into `.csv` files that list out the comments and their pages.

## Usage

Navigate to https://thistemba.github.io/fdf-to-csv/ and upload your `.fdf` file. The `.csv` file will be downloaded automatically.

## Note

(I haven't actually tested this at all at the time of writing, if the link doesn't work then I forgot to host it on github pages)
